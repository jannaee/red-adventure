Pool Pro Requirements:
We ask that you complete a code project that our team will review. Our expectation is that this project will be a good representation of your work, so please invest sufficient time to demonstrate your level of work.
I understand you have ongoing commitments, and my expectations are not that you drop everything to complete this immediately. You are not being judged on time to complete, but rather the quality of code and thought put into the project. 
Overview
Here at Red Ventures, we look to hire developers who are technically skilled and passionate about the Web. To help us better understand your strengths in these areas, we’d like for your to complete a coding challenge. Look at this as an opportunity to show off your development skills and build us something awesome.
 
The principles and concepts of development that we value most are:
•	Web Standards
•	Readability
•	Performance
•	Form Validation
•	Semantic Markup
The Challenge
The attached zip contains a series of PSD files and supporting assets that illustrate how the page should look upon completion. Your challenge is to render this design as a fully functional web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your page should render perfectly in all major browsers. We encourage you to make this as interactive and creative as possible.
 
Technical Guidelines
•	No CSS libraries/frameworks may be used, however, CSS (pre)processors like Sass are encouraged for compiling your own CSS.
•	Any JavaScript frameworks are allowed (We love to see Vanilla solutions too!).
•	The page should be responsive for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop.
•	Dealers section should be built using the provided JSON file.
Submitting Your Completed Challenge
Send your finished project via a public link to a Google Drive folder (or another similar service) that contains your finalized assets. The finalized project should follow the following specs:
•	Excludes the node_modules directory (or other similar package manager directories).
•	Should have a distribution folder that can be viewed directly in a browser.
•	Should not require a build process to view the site.
Good luck and we look forward to seeing your work! Please be sure you have a OneDrive account or the most recent update of Windows10.
