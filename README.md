The Challenge
Convert series of PSD files and supporting assets into a fully functional web page:

Technical Guidelines
•	No CSS libraries/frameworks may be used, however, CSS (pre)processors like Sass are encouraged for compiling your own CSS.
•	Any JavaScript frameworks are allowed (We love to see Vanilla solutions too!).
•	The page should be responsive for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop.
•	Dealers section should be built using the provided JSON file.

On Completion checklist:
Send your finished project via a public link to a Google Drive folder (or another similar service) that contains your finalized assets. The finalized project should follow the following specs:
[ ] Excludes the node_modules directory (or other similar package manager directories).
[ ] Should have a distribution folder that can be viewed directly in a browser.
[ ] Should not require a build process to view the site.
